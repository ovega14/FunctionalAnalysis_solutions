# Solution Manual For Functional Analysis (MIT 18.102)



### Overview

This repository will contain my solutions to the assignments from **18.102 Introduction to Functional Analysis**, offered at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) during the Spring 2021 semester and taught by Professor Casey Rodriguez. The materials are obtained from [MIT OpenCourseWare (OCW)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-102-introduction-to-functional-analysis-spring-2021/). 

This manual is written in $\LaTeX$, and note that I purposely do not omit any of the additional output files Tex generates when compiling the documents. So not only can you view the PDF files containing the written up solutions, but also the other files-- chiefly important among which is the typesetting code that you can examine and/or edit on your own. I will continue updating these files as I keep working through the course assignments. 



### Contribute

This repository is a work-in-progress, and ideally will always remain so. The goal in creating this manual is firstly to offer the first publicly available solutions to the exercises for this course, but also to inspire further mathematical discussion and revisions to the solutions and ideas presented here. 

Please note that the solutions here presented are my own, and are all imperfect. For some of the exercises, I am even uncertain about my approach or am not fully satisfied with the logic of my proofs. In those cases, any kind of contribution or feedback is greatly appreciated. 

There are a many ways in which you can contribute to the improvement of this repository:
1. Add/edit questions
1. Add/edit answers
1. Open issues to share suggestions on existing solutions
1. Offer your own alternative solutions
1. Submit pull requests

For questions or concerns, feel free to contact me at <vega00087@alum.mit.edu>.



### Acknowledgments

1. Special thanks to [MIT OCW](https://ocw.mit.edu) for making available the full lecture videos, lecture notes, and assignments for this course as well as for many others published online. I hope to see more advanced mathematics courses with full materials published on OCW in the future.
