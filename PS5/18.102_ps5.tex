\subsection*{(a)}
\begin{proof}
	($\Rightarrow$) Suppose $f$ is measurable. 
	
	Let $\alpha \in \R$. We may express the preimage of the set $(\alpha, \infty]$ under the inverse of the restriction of $f$ to $E$ as follows:
	\begin{equation}\label{f-inv-E}
		f^{-1}\big|_E \left((\alpha, \infty])\right) = f^{-1}\left((\alpha, \infty])\right) \cap E,
	\end{equation}
	and similarly for $F$:
	\begin{equation}\label{f-inv-F}
		f^{-1}\big|_F \left((\alpha, \infty])\right) = f^{-1}\left((\alpha, \infty])\right) \cap F.
	\end{equation}
	Since $f$ is measurable, then $f^{-1}\left((\alpha, \infty])\right) \in \M$. By assumption, $E$ and $F$ are also measurable. Hence, the intersections in \eqref{f-inv-E} and \eqref{f-inv-F} are also measurable. 
	
	Therefore, $f\big|_E$ and $f\big|_F$ are measurable.
	
	($\Leftarrow$) Suppose $f\big|_E$ and $f\big|_F$ are measurable.
	
	Then for ever $\alpha \in \R$, $f^{-1}\big|_E \left((\alpha, \infty])\right) \in \M$ and $f^{-1}\big|_F \left((\alpha, \infty])\right) \in \M$. Since $\M$ is closed under taking finite unions, then the union of each of these sets is also measurable, i.e.
	\begin{equation}
		f^{-1}\big|_E \left((\alpha, \infty])\right) \cup f^{-1}\big|_F \left((\alpha, \infty])\right) \in \M.
	\end{equation}
	We also have that $E, F \in \M$, so $E \cup F \in \M$. Then we have
	\begin{align}
		f^{-1}\big|_E \left((\alpha, \infty])\right) \cup f^{-1}\big|_F \left((\alpha, \infty])\right) \\= \left(f^{-1}\left((\alpha, \infty])\right) \cap E\right) \cup \left(f^{-1}\left((\alpha, \infty])\right) \cap F\right) \nonumber \\
		= f^{-1}\left((\alpha,\infty]\right) \cap (E \cup F) \\ 
		= f^{-1}\left((\alpha,\infty]\right) \in \M, \label{inv-subset-union}
	\end{align}
	where in line \eqref{inv-subset-union} we used the fact that $f^{-1}\left((\alpha,\infty]\right) \subset (E \cup F)$. 
	
	Therefore, as desired, $f$ must be measurable.
\end{proof}
